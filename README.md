# reclothenation-app

At ReClotheNation, our mission is to create a sustainable and compassionate community by connecting those who have gently used or worn out clothes with those who need them most. We understand the importance of reducing textile waste and ensuring that clothes are reused and recycled in the most environmentally conscious way possible.

Our platform allows individuals to donate reusable clothes to NGOs, which then distribute them to those in need, or to recycling companies that can repurpose them. We also help users locate the nearest NGO to their location to make the donation process as easy as possible.
