## Problem Statement 
The textile industry is a major contributor to environmental pollution, generating an estimated 92 million tons of textile waste worldwide each year. The traditional linear model of “take, make, use and throw away” is unsustainable and creates vast amounts of waste. This problem is due to the lack of proper recycling infrastructure, limited public awareness and limited access to sustainable apparel practices. Garment waste generated by consumers, manufacturers and retailers often ends up in landfills, with negative environmental impacts. The current system was not designed to facilitate the transition to a circular economy model that is essential for the long-term sustainability of the fashion industry. A platform connecting donors, NGOs and recycling companies is urgently needed to address this issue. Such platforms will facilitate the reuse and recycling of clothing waste, enable sustainable clothing practices, and reduce the environmental impact of the textile industry for a renewable future.

## Solution - [Explaination of the project](https://youtu.be/BWimYshBVLY)
At ReClotheNation, our mission is to create a sustainable and compassionate community by connecting those who have gently used or worn out clothes with those who need them most. We understand the importance of reducing textile waste and ensuring that clothes are reused and recycled in the most environmentally conscious way possible.
Our platform allows individuals to donate reusable clothes to NGOs, which then distribute them to those in need, or to recycling companies that can repurpose them. We also help users locate the nearest NGO to their location to make the donation process as easy as possible.
